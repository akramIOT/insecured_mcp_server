## Insecured MCP Server Functionality

Insecured MCP Server Simulation â€“ Agentic Tool Schema Attack

This repository simulates an **insecure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** to demonstrate potential **security threat vectors** targeting **Agentic Tool Schemas** in LLM-based systems. It serves as an educational and research tool for testing, identifying, and remediating misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the MCP-based Agentic toolchain.

---

##  Purpose

- Simulate a **Realistic MCP Server threat environment** targeting insecure Agentic Tool schema exchanges.

- Demonstrate **attack vectors** like:
  - Unauthorized tool execution
  - Agentic Tool schema Manipulation, Malicious Tool Injection to an MCP Server and Agent spoofing
 
- Serve as a **testbed** for red-teaming, blue-teaming, and LLMOps security teams to harden Agentic pipelines.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Minimal insecure MCP server implementation (HTTP/SSE)
- Malicious tool injection simulation
